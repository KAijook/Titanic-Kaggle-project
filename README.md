# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster ðŸš¢

This project is a solution for the classic [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), where the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, gender, class, and more.


## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **Goal**: Build a machine learning model to classify passengers as *survived* or *not survived*.  
- **Dataset**: Provided by Kaggle ("train.csv", "test.csv").  
- **Approach**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and graph making.  
- **Models used**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM).  
- **Result**: Achieved a Kaggle score of **X.XXXX** (fill in your best score).

  Typical libraries used:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn
- scikit-learn
 
ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Some insights discovered:
Women and children had a higher survival rate.
Passengers in higher classes (1st class) survived more often.
Family size and ticket fare were useful engineered features.
(Include plots or screenshots if you want.)

ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

Tried multiple classifiers and tuned hyperparameters with GridSearchCV.
Random Forest gave the best results.
Final model performance: Accuracy: 0.82 on validation set.

ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
Use ensemble stacking for better predictions.
Experiment with neural networks.
Add cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
